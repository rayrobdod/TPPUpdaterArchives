<p>"The Live Updates will stick with more frequent updates, with all important events bolded. With an equal split between those who want "less" and those who want "more", having updates bolded allows people to find the major events faster while others enjoy the smaller tidbits.

Things just picked up in the last hour as we finished the Tower and got the Flute, and now the gang's on their way toward Snorlax with 3 Great Balls burning a hole in their pocket.</p></div></up>
